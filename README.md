# Odin-Project-Landing-Page

This is my landing page assigned in the Odin Project flexbox section. Though I was already familiar with flexbox, this project reinforced its potency in my mind, just by seeing how easily I could arrange elements on the page.

The basic structure has been kept the same, but I've changed the colour palette to burgundy and gray, as I wish to also work on design skills in addition to coding skills.
